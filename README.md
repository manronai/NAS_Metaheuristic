Abstract: Balancing fairness, robustness, and accuracy in machine learning models is a challenging task. Many existing methods focus on one or two aspects but fail to optimize all three effectively. This paper proposes a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that uses multi-objective optimization to design models that are both fair and robust while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach applies evolutionary algorithms to explore different network architectures, optimizing them for fairness, robustness against adversarial attacks, and overall performance. By incorporating fairness-aware loss functions and adversarial training, the method dynamically selects the best architectures to reduce bias and improve resilience. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our NAS-driven models perform better than traditional fairness-aware and robust training methods. This work highlights the potential of automated architecture search for developing reliable and unbiased machine learning models.
